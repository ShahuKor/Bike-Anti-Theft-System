# Bike-Anti-Theft-System

## Introduction 
The Bike Anti-Theft System is an innovative solution designed to enhance the security of bicycles using IoT technology. The system offers advanced features such as remote electronic locking, motion detection alerts, real-time GPS tracking, and a dedicated mobile application for full control. This project ensures the safety of bicycles, providing peace of mind to bike owners with internet-based remote monitoring and control.

## Features
1. **Electronic Locking Mechanism**  
   The bike lock can be controlled remotely via an IoT mobile application, allowing users to lock or unlock their bike effortlessly from anywhere with an active internet connection.

2. **Motion Detection Sensor**  
   Equipped with a motion detection sensor, the system detects even the slightest movement or tampering while the bike is locked, sending real-time alerts to the user through the mobile
   app.

4. **GPS Tracking**  
   Real-time GPS technology tracks the precise location of the bike, ensuring the user always knows where their bike is located.

5. **IoT Mobile Application**  
   A user-friendly mobile application serves as the control hub, allowing users to:
   - Receive tampering alerts
   - Lock/unlock the bike remotely
   - View the bikeâ€™s GPS location

6. **Range-Independent Control**  
   Since the system operates via the internet, users can monitor and control their bike from any distance, as long as they are connected to the internet.
